->Angular is JS Framework which is use to create attractive single page website.


Difference between Angular vs Angular 1 vs Lastest Version o f angular.


Angular 1 (angularJs) ->there were lots of flaws in this version so angular was updated to 1 2 3 10,12,13,and so on.


angular installation :-  npm install -g @angular/cli

ng version:- to check the angular version 
ng serve to run the server

ng new project name to create the angular project.

ngModel ->listen what is in input tag and store it in paragraph
<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name"/>
<p> {{name}}</p>

TYPESCRIPT:-

TS is superset of JS (as it offers more features than JS like Classess,INterface,strong typing let n:Number=>accepts only the integer data)

TS is not understood by browser because of this TS is compiled to JS by CLI to make it easily understood by browser.

How Does Angular Project is Started?

pehele index.html load hota hai browser pe
main.ts pe bootstrap pe jo file bhejta hai woh component intially render hota hai
waha se hum woh componenet ka tmplate render krte hai app.component.html file 


  selector:'app-server',//html tag ke liye hota hai jo hum component ts mai likhte hai
    templateUrl:'./server.component.html' ->html file of the same component

    create a component throught command line :-

    @Component({
      selector:""// html tag,
      templateUrls:[] //pass the relative path for html file
      template:'' for inline html tags
      styles:'' for inline styling
      stylesUrls:[] //pass the relative path for css file
          })

  
  What is DataBinding?
  --> Communication between typescript(business logic) and html template =>response the output to the html template 
    stringInterpolation 1.[{{data}}] 2.['property']="data

    vice versa
    when and event occurs the request is sent tot the business logic
        Event Binding:- ((event):"expression")

    two way binding:-[ngModel]="data"

    String INterpolation =>return the string or the data which can be easily converted into string,we cant write any conditions in string interpolation can call the function which will return only string.


    PROPERTY BINDING:-
    

    Directives:are instruction in the DOM
